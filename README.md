# Hangman Terminal Game

This is a terminal based version of the hangman game. You can play with friends.
It includes ASCII art to indicate the remaining lives. Hope you enjoy!

# Rules
1. Enter the names of the players in order (you can use dices to dictate the order prior to playing).
2. Each player gets a turn to guess one letter.
3. Repeated letters still count as a turn, though the program will alert you, so you do not use that letter again.
4. Everyone gets 6 lives.
5. You will get a bit of a hint in the form of a display of blanks indicating the number of letters in the word.
6. First to guess the word wins
